                    <p class="body">NYUAD Slush’D is led by Violet Ventures at NYUAD, selected as one of the 6 Slush’D partnership teams for 2022 and was the only university-level partner amongst the cohort. </p>
                    <p class="body">The specific bottlenecks NYUAD Slush’D aims to tackle are threefold: 1) many youth do not yet see entrepreneurship as a way to contribute social good to society 2) despite having disruptive and impact-driven students, talent is still largely driven to major corporations 3) our students lack the first steps on the brainstorming process behind venture building, especially for international students in this region.</p>

                <p class="body">The Hult Prize challenges young people around the world to solve the planet's most
                    pressing issues through social entrepreneurship. Every year, a prompt is released and the team with
                    the best pitch will receive 1 million dollars to execute their social enterprise, for real. <br>
                    <br>
                    This year's prompt is redesigning fashion - an attempt to better a world that is drowning with
                    climate change and labor supply chain problems. <br>
                    <br>
                    Violet Ventures has paired with the Hult Prize Foundation to select NYUAD’s representative for the
                    regional Hult Prize summit in Dubai, March 2023. The winning team will go to Boston to compete for
                    the grand prize. <br>
                    <br>
                    Our 2 - day NYUAD Slush’D event will serve as a preparatory bootcamp for the Hult Global Finals and
                    aims to equip 12 teams with the tools and skills needed forthe brainstorming and ideation process.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    3 weeks later, on November 26th, Violet Ventures will host the Hult Prize Competition Pitch, where
                    NYUAD’s Hult Prize representative will be ultimately chosen. The selected team will go through
                    further rounds of training and mentorship prior to the summit which will take place in March 2023.

                    <p>Ayoola is an Engineer and social entrepreneur. He co-founded Cycled Technologies in 2016 to
                        deliver waste management products and services that help buildings and municipalities recycle
                        more and reduce logistics expenses. Since then, he has led operations at the company and
                        championed the development of the Cycled Self Sorting SmartBin Technology which earned him an
                        “MIT Technology Reviews Innovator Under 35” recognition. Ayoola also holds a PhD in Mechanical
                        Engineering and by virtue of his scientific exploits, he was involved in the development of the
                        Non-contact Multiphysics Probe, which is a groundbreaking addition to the toolkit of the Human
                        Atlas Project -- the world's most ambitious genetic research project.

                        Prior to co-founding Cycled Technologies, Ayoola served as the Executive Director of Nordoest
                        which was the Middle East’s Representative of Innovation Norway — the Norwegian Government’s
                        most important instrument for innovation and development of Norwegian enterprises. He also
                        served as the Technical Director of Nordic Innovation Hub — a cleantech incubator in Masdar City
                        Abu Dhabi, set up as a collaboration between the five Nordic countries and supported by Nordic
                        Innovation.

                        Ayoola will be speaking in the founder panel about passion and mission building through his
                        venture.
